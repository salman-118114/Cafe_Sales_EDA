# Cafe_Sales_EDA
This project focuses on cleaning a synthetic dataset that simulates sales transactions in a caf√©. The dataset was intentionally designed to be "dirty", containing common real-world data issues:
Missing values
Inconsistent entries (e.g., "ERROR", "UNKNOWN")
Incorrect data types
Implausible or corrupted values (e.g., negative quantities, wrong totals)
The goal is to apply structured data cleaning techniques in Python (with Pandas and Numpy) to prepare the dataset for further analysis and visualization.

Project Goals
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Identify missing, incorrect, or inconsistent values
Impute or remove problematic entries
Standardize text and categorical fields
Correct data types and ensure logical consistency
Validate calculations and prepare for further analysis
